# Racer-3LA
Racer-3LA is a look alike version of the DRL Racer 3. Hence the name, Racer 3LA (Look Alike).

# Tech

To build a proper replica you should use the following components:
  Battery - Pulse 70C 5S (18.5V) 1,800mAh
  Flight Controller - F3 with Betaflight 3
  Motors - Tornado T2 1800KV
  Propellers - HQProp DP 6x4x3B
  
We recommend changing out the flight controller for a F4 with smart audio and change out the ESC's with a 4in1 combo board to save space and weight.

# Additional Electronics
Dont forget about the Most important part... LEDs!

    We recommend getting this printed with a SLA printer. A head-on colision with the camera will damage the camera either way so the      material here does not matter.
